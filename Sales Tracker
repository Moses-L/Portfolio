About this project:  I designed and developed an interactive sales performance dashboard to track total sales, regional trends, and profitability using data visualization techniques. Integrated key business metrics, including total profit, sales by category, and monthly sales trends. Implemented advanced filtering for customer type, payment method, and region to enhance decision-making. Leveraged visual analytics to provide insights into regional sales performance, top-performing managers, and order status distribution. Utilized data-driven storytelling to improve strategic planning and sales optimization.
